# Parkometer 2000
Tells the distance to the store's entrance to help you optimize your parking. 

It has a list of points of interest and calculates and displays the nearest two on the LCD. Distance  is displayed in meters. 

The goal of this project was to find areas in a parking lot that were unpopular because they seemed farther such as around the corner of a building, off to the side, since it seemed a lot of people would prefer to park 100 meters back on the lane leading up to the doors rather than 50 meters in a front spot in a few lanes over. The legendary golden parking spots did in fact exist and the parkometer was an incredibly roundabout but fun way to discover them.
