1) Output into a file with just the data structure exactly how it will be declared in arduino.

2) Copy that into sketch at tome

3) Write loop that iterates through each nested array and calculates distance

4) Output distance in console

5) Create the top two method to extract top two closest and write those out

6) Add LCD part to output and keep in mind you can only have x number of characters minus distance. Handle edge case that the nearest point is a large distance and it takes up the lcd screen. maybe create a conditional so if it's larger than 999 meters it switches measurement to km. 

so 356m and 1.3km 99.9km 

Max number would be 7 including the space after. which LCD is 16 across so i guess i designated 7 spaces regardless that only leaves me with 9 for the detail... i guess i could reduce that so if it's above 9999 meters  it doesn't display. 

so 9999m means 6 including space which means 10 name spaces. maybe add a warning listing names that are larger than 10 characters like 
******Warning******


have a sketch that gets the first point and measures the distance and outputs distance

do the stuff that figures out top 2 and outputs those in console

hook up lcd and do that part
